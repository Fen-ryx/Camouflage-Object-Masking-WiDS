# <b>Camouflage Object Masking</b>

## Introduction
Camouflage Object Masking deals with the task of identifying and segmenting out objects that are not well-distinguished from their backgrounds. This is a specialized problem within the domain of Computer Vision, which has been seeing and continues to see rapid advances and novel techniques.<br>
Camouflage Object Masking has several applications across varied fields including medical image segementation, rare species discovery, the miliary, and so on. Recent work also suggests that research in AI-based segmentation of camouflaged objects could hold key insights into how the hierarchial levels of human visual perception are structured.<br>

## Structure
This project would be structured as follows:<br>
1. Learn about the basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning
2. Understand Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Learn to use Machine Learning frameworks - PyTorch
4. Research and apply specific Neural Nets to deal with the problem statement
5. Tune and evaluate trained models
<!-- end of the list -->

## Details
The primary framework that will be used is <b>PyTorch</b>. You are also welcome to use <b>TensorFlow</b> if that is what you are comfortable with.<br>
This project would be completed over the course of 4 weeks. At the end of each week, an assignment would be posted. This is purely for you to see whether you're able to grasp the materials provided or not. They will not be evaluated.<br>
The final code for your Camouflage Object Segmentation model will need to be submitted, and will be what you are evaluated upon.

## Resources
#### Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning
1. Check out Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera<br>
Complete the first course. You are also welcome to go ahead and finish the second course, though this is purely optional.<br>
There is no need to do the programming assignments.<br>

2. Watch this playlist which serves as an introduction to PyTorch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M <br>
For those of you who'd prefer TensorFlow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk <br>
Do any <b>one</b> of PyTorch or TensorFlow, do not waste time on both at the moment.

#### Week 2: Diving Deeper into Deep Learning and Introduction to CNNs
1. Another playlist for PyTorch, which goes a bit deeper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0 <br>
Go through this entire playlist as it covers CNNs pretty well, in the later stages.
2. Some reading for CNNs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network
3. MIT OCW Lecture on CNNs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaSUYvmCekI
4. You might also want to explore the course on CNNs on Coursera, by DeepLearning.AI: https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks

#### Week 3: Studying the Problem of Camouflage Object Masking
1. A paper on a widely used Segmentation Network: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf <br>
2. A paper on a model I have used in the past for the task of Camouflage Object Masking: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144.pdf <br>
3. A paper which deals specifically with the task of Camouflage Object Masking: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314219300608 <br>
You are encouraged to explore other architectures that might perform well on the task at hand.<br>
4. An article to study and understand evaluation metrics for segmentation models: https://towardsdatascience.com/metrics-to-evaluate-your-semantic-segmentation-model-6bcb99639aa2 <br>

#### Week 4: Implementing Studied Architectures
This week is all about implementing and fine-tuning the architectures we have studied.<br>
There are no resources for this week, all you need to do is present a working model of your code at the end, along with the results you have obtained. <br>
These will be the basis of what you are evaluated upon.<br>
Here is the link to the final dataset we would be working on: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h-OqZdwkuPhBvGcVAwmh0f1NGqlH_4B6?usp=share_link <br>
You are welcome to use any other appropriate dataset.
